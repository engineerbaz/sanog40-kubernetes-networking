#Kubernetes Networking: Under the Hood and Beyond

Welcome to the Kubernetes Networking lab!!

This lab will guide you through hands-on exploratory stages, each of which will introduce you to a unique aspect of Kubernetes networking. The steps are designed to take approximately 10 to 15 minutes, but they serve as an excellent starting point for hours of additional exploration.

### Lab requirement
The lab systems provided for in-person participants are Ubuntu 20.04 cloud instances with 2CPU/4GB/30GB of storage. If you are conducting the laboratories in a virtual environment or after the tutorial session, the lab should function properly on any Ubuntu 20.04 base system. You can find instructions for running a local Ubuntu 20.04 VM on your laptop to complete the lab here

Let's get started networking!!

N.B. The lab steps below show you commands to run and sample output from a demo system. Read the lab steps carefully as you will need to change many commands to use your own IP addresses, pod names, etc., all of which will be different from those shown in the lab examples.

1. Pod Networking
To begin our Kubernetes networking journey we'll need to setup a Kubernetes cluster to work with.
