# SANOG40 Technical Session on Kubernetes Networking

Technical session "*Kubernetes Networking: Under the Hood and Beyond*" at SANOG40 (https://www.sanog.org/sanog40/)


_Kubernetes_ is a powerful container orchestration platform that can be used to deploy and manage complex applications at scale. However, Kubernetes networking can be a complex topic, and it can be difficult to understand how to configure and optimise Kubernetes networks.

In this presentation, we will take a deep dive into Kubernetes networking. We will discuss the basics of Kubernetes networking, including pods, services, and networking plugins. We will also briefly describe advanced topics, such as network policies, load balancing, and ingress controllers.

This presentation is designed for both beginners and experienced Kubernetes users. We will provide a clear and concise overview of Kubernetes networking, and we will share best practices for configuring and optimising Kubernetes networks.
